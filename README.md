# InsaneInk Website REVAMPED

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To the incoming/current VPs of Web Dev... good luck lmao

## What is this?

This is either going to be the easiest or hardest challenge you will face in coding.

To put it bluntly, the way this site is written is complex.

The website was originally PHP (you can use this if you are more comfortable), but THIS site is in ReactJS.

This means that instead of having a single file for a single page (if you have/had Web Tech you will know how HTML files are written), you have to create components.
And use these components to form pages, and etc. etc.

Now why is this better than HTML? Well it's just much easier to add new things and save code space (also a whole lot of technical jargle).

Well.. let's get started. There is A LOT to cover.

## Laying Foundation

When it comes to ReactJS, either you know it... or you don't.

But that's alright, here's a general overview of what you need to know.

So the very first thing you will see are three main files:
- public
- src
- node_modules

Now #1 thing, NEVER edit, add, or remove the node_modules (unless you know what it is of course)
node_modules is basically the skeleton of the website, it is what the site uses to exist.

The two things you should look into though are src and public

src is where your source code is, it is where you should be doing the most of your work. Inside will be images, css, js, and essentially everything.

public is the "display" of the site, it's what React uses to host what you've coded. The only thing that should maybe be changed in that file is the title of the site or the icon.
