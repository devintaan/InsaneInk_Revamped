# InsaneInk Website REVAMPED

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To the incoming/current VPs of Web Dev... good luck lmao

## What is this?

Congrats current VP! This is either going to be the easiest or hardest challenge of your life.

So to put it bluntly, the way this site is written is complex. 

Instead of having a single file for a single page (if you have/had Web Tech you will know how HTML files are written), you have to create components.
You use these components to form pages, and etc. etc.

Now why is this better than HTML? Well really there isn't much, just that it is much easier to add new things and save code space (also a whole lot of technical jargle).

Well.. let's get started.
