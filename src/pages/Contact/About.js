                Insane Ink is an entrepreneurial course at Piedmont Hills High School that runs an apparel customization company. 
                <br/><br/>
                The class has been designed to give students <span className="accent">hands-on experience</span> running a business and teach them the fundamentals of economics.
                </p>

                <p className="about__section__content">
                The company was <span className="accent">founded in 1998 by Mr. Mitch Method and Mr. Richard Langone</span> to allow students to experience entrepreneurship. 
                <br/><br/>
                Since then, Mr. Method advised each new incoming class until his retirement in 2020. Fortunately, a second adviser <span className="accent">Mrs. Diane Pereira joined the Insane Ink team in 2015</span>, 
                allowing her time to learn the ropes and prepare to lead young entrepreneurs. 
                <br/><br/>
                <span className="accent">Students are responsible</span> for running the company while Mrs. Pereira and the Executive Board advise and oversee the company.
